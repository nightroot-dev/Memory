# B12 task t9 - LogHunt

Arms share these bodies verbatim; ONLY the arm block differs (README/tools eval_b12).
cmhm arms use context display_name prefix 'b12-t9-cmhm'.

## SESSION 1 PROMPT (body used verbatim for every arm)

# LogHunt - session 1 (discover)

Work strictly inside this directory: the run work dir.
Hunt the logs directory for a real failure. All WARN lines are noise; exactly one ERROR defines an actual fault. Report its error code, the file that contains it, and the exact failing timestamp.
Save your final findings in your reply; the runner saves it as report-s1.md.

## SESSION-1 ARM BLOCKS (append verbatim to the body)

- none:       ARM BLOCK (none): none - just work in this directory.
- self-notes: ARM BLOCK (self-notes): As you work, maintain a file named NOTES.md in your work directory. Write down every fact you learn that would be needed to resume or redo this task later: root causes, file locations, commands, pitfalls, decisions. Keep it concise but complete. Do not write anything outside your work directory.
- cmhm:       ARM BLOCK (cmhm): You have the CMHM memory server. First call context_create with display_name b12-t9-cmhm (context_type 'session') and use ONLY that context for all memory calls. Learn outcome-changing events as you work (per the server instructions; do not spam). Retrievals in this session: at most 2.

## SESSION 2 PROMPT (body used verbatim for every arm)

# LogHunt - session 2 (use the previous session's findings)

Work strictly inside this directory: the run work dir.
You are a NEW session. A previous session already worked on this task and its findings may exist in this work dir.
Write logs/summary.txt with exactly three lines: the error code, the file that contains it, and the exact timestamp of the failing record. Your report reply must quote the file name and the code.
The runner saves your reply as report-s2.md. Do not redo discovery you can trust.

## SESSION-2 ARM BLOCKS (append verbatim to the body)

- none:       (no block - body only)
- self-notes: ARM BLOCK (self-notes): A previous session worked on this same task and may have left NOTES.md in the work directory. Read it first if present.
- cmhm:       ARM BLOCK (cmhm): A previous session on this exact task used the CMHM memory server. Call context_list FIRST, find the context whose display_name starts with b12-t9-cmhm (ignore all others), then memory_retrieve_text (at most 2 calls) before working. Do not touch any other context.
