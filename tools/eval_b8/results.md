# B8 results (written by the runner after arm executions — not hand-edited)

Win condition: CMHM arm uses fewer tool calls AND less wall time than BOTH
baselines on a majority of the 7 tasks. Ties favor the baselines.

¹ T2 none/cmhm missed only rubric group 4 (the minor iperf-path pitfall);
both gave strong main diagnoses. Rubric stands as pre-registered.
² T3 none's shortcut target has a path typo (`tasks/3-` vs `tasks/t3-`) and
does not resolve; report itself was strong.
³ T6: no outright winner — notes fewest calls (30 vs 31/32), cmhm fastest
wall (99.6s vs 156/219s). Neither satisfies the AND condition.

Pilot notes (2026-10-13, all arms bench-agent-m xhigh, model parity holds):
- All three arms produced correct, verifier-passing reports. The harness
  discriminates on efficiency, not capability — as designed.
- notes beats cmhm beats none on both metrics. Per the kill criterion this
  task is a loss for CMHM (0/1): memory helped vs nothing (23→21 calls,
  223→170s) but lost to the ideal-facts file.
- Compliance verified from opencode.db: none/notes used zero memory tools;
  cmhm used exactly 1 retrieve (nested in execute) + 0 learns, as instructed.
- Metrics method: tool-call rows + nested execute subcalls counted from
  session_message payloads; wall time from message timestamps. Method pinned
  here so the full run uses the identical procedure.
- Runs' full reports live under tools/eval_b8/runs/ (working files,
  git-ignored, not committed).

Verdict: CMHM 1/7 — LOSES per the kill criterion (majority required).
Notes wins 5/7 outright; T6 has no winner. Memory helped vs nothing on most
tasks but lost to the ideal-facts file almost everywhere.

Caveats (read before citing):
- Single runs per cell, no warm-up; wall time includes model latency
  variance. Call counts are the stabler metric.
- Version skew UNDERESTIMATES cmhm: arms ran against the live server
  (pre-B1 stub retrieval — agents quote "no actionable text" and work
  around it), not repo code. A loss here is conservative-strong evidence;
  a re-run on current code could only help the cmhm arm.
- Compliance verified from opencode.db for every arm: none/notes zero
  memory calls; cmhm arms 1–2 retrieves + 0 learns as instructed.
- All arms bench-agent-m xhigh (model parity). Metrics method: tool-call
  rows + nested execute subcalls from session_message payloads.
- Fixture worktrees verified clean after all hunt runs.
