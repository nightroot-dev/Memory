# B8 results (written by the runner after arm executions — not hand-edited)

Win condition: CMHM arm uses fewer tool calls AND less wall time than BOTH
baselines on a majority of the 7 tasks. Ties favor the baselines.

| task | none: calls | none: time | none: pass | notes: calls | notes: time | notes: pass | cmhm: calls | cmhm: time | cmhm: pass | winner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| t4-hunt-wal-replay (pilot) | 23 | 222.9s | PASS | 15 | 99.0s | PASS | 21 (1 retrieve) | 170.3s | PASS | notes |

Pilot notes (2026-10-13, all arms bench-agent-m xhigh, model parity holds):
- All three arms produced correct, verifier-passing reports. The harness
  discriminates on efficiency, not capability — as designed.
- notes beats cmhm beats none on both metrics. Per the kill criterion this
  task is a loss for CMHM (0/1): memory helped vs nothing (23→21 calls,
  223→170s) but lost to the ideal-facts file.
- Compliance verified from opencode.db: none/notes used zero memory tools;
  cmhm used exactly 1 retrieve (nested in execute) + 0 learns, as instructed.
- Metrics method: tool-call rows + nested execute subcalls counted from
  session_message payloads; wall time from message timestamps. Method pinned
  here so the full run uses the identical procedure.
- Runs' full reports live under tools/eval_b8/runs/ (working files,
  git-ignored, not committed).

Verdict: PENDING (pilot reviewed; full 6 remaining tasks not yet run).
